# Sang Tran Portfolio V1.0 🚀

This is my personal portfolio built with [Reactfolio](https://github.com/harindulakmal/reactfolio), customized to showcase my work as a **Technical VFX Artist** for both **Web3 games** and **AAA cinematic trailers**.

🧠 I combine technical knowledge and artistic sense to create cinematic real-time effects using **Houdini, Unreal Engine, Blender, and Python**.  
🎮 I've worked on projects like *Spider-Man 2*, *Fortnite*, *Black Knight (Netflix)*, and a Web3 shooter called *Havoc*.
